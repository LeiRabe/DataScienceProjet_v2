Id,Plot,Title
1,"ld Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as ""enemies"" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ""Beasts of England"".
When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion.
The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer mr Jones from the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"".
They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, ""All animals are equal"".
Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism.
Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.
The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.
Some time later, several men attack Animal Farm.
Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts.
Snowball, who has been studying the battles of Julius Caesar in anticipation of such a fight, orders the animals to retreat, then counterstrikes, forcing the men to flee.
Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed ""The Battle of the Cowshed"".
It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution.
Napoleon and Snowball struggle for pre-eminence.
When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a windmill, Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.
Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm.
Through a young pig named Squealer, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea.
The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill.
When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project.
Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat, Napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival.
When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle.
""Beasts of England"" is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man.
The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under mr Jones.
Mr Frederick, one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill.
Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded.
Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill.
Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there.
Benjamin, the cynical donkey who ""could read as well as any pig"", notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue.
Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted.
In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways.
However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves.
(In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue) Years pass, and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill, which makes the farm a good amount of income.
However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives.
In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England.
The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes.
The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: ""All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others"".
Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance.
He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name ""The Manor Farm"".
As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.
",Animal Farm
2,"
Alex is a 15-year-old living in near-future dystopian England who leads his gang on a night of opportunistic, random ""ultra-violence"".
Alex's friends (""droogs"" in the novel's Anglo-Russian slang, 'Nadsat') are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence.
Characterised as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex also displays intelligence, quick wit, and a predilection for classical music; he is particularly fond of Beethoven, referred to as ""Lovely Ludwig Van"".
The novella begins with the droogs sitting in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking ""milk-plus""—a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice—to prepare for a night of mayhem.
They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang.
Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and raping his wife.
In a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called ""A Clockwork Orange"", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript.
Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent.
At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.
Alex coyly feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day.
Following an unexpected visit fromR.
Deltoid, his ""post-corrective adviser"", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls.
He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them.
The next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby.
Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a ""man-sized"" job.
Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman.
Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight.
The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in their custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.
Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day informed him that Georgie has been killed).
Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services.
The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages.
After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted.
The technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence.
As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.
The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a bully and abases himself before a scantily-clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations.
Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released from prison.
Alex returns to his parents' flat, only to find that they are renting his room to a lodger.
Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide.
The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends.
Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader.
They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there.
Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1.
The writer, Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape.
He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone.
Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected.
Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers.
He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.
Alex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt.
With Alexander placed in a mental institution, Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government.
A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning.
As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, ""I was cured all right"".
In the final chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly preparing for yet another night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully).
After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence.
He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting on the notion that his own children will be just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.
",A Clockwork Orange (novel)
3,"
The text of The Plague is divided into five parts.
In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets.
Hysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident.
Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague.
The main character, dr Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever.
dr Rieux consults his colleague, dr Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town.
They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death.
However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic.
Meanwhile, Rieux's wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city, to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness.
Authorities, including the Prefect, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take.
Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation.
A ""special ward"" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days.
As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken.
Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised.
A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is enough to treat only existing cases, and the country's emergency reserves are depleted.
When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed, and an outbreak of plague is officially declared.
The town is sealed off.
The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended.
The use of telephone lines is restricted only to ""urgent"" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town.
The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters.
One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in Paris after city officials refused his request to leave.
He befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city.
Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature.
His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances.
Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler.
Meanwhile, dr Rieux; a vacationer, Jean Tarrou; and a civil servant, Joseph Grand, exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital.
Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that there are others in the city, including dr Rieux, who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind.
He then decides to join Tarrou and dr Rieux to help fight the epidemic.
In mid-August, the situation continues to worsen.
People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries.
Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew.
Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased.
The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation.
Despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically.
In September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague.
Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening.
He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work.
Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger.
Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance.
After extended negotiations with guards, Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left.
Towards the end of October, Castel's new antiplague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou tend to his bedside in horror.
Paneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon.
He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything.
He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague.
A few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill.
His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal.
Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon.
When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son.
Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life and, to take their mind off the epidemic, the two men go swimming together in the sea.
Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers.
However, Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline.
By late January the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates.
Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease.
Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic from which he has profited by shady dealings.
Two government employees approach him, and he flees.
Despite the epidemic's ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle.
Rieux is later informed via telegram that his wife has also died.
In February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities.
Rambert is reunited with his wife.
Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home.
He is arrested.
Grand begins working on his novel again.
The narrator of the chronicle reveals his identity and states and that he tried to present an objective view of the events.
The narrator reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.

4,"
Among others, John Heath has observed, ""The unalterable kernel of the tale was a hunter's transformation into a deer and his death in the jaws of his hunting dogs.
But authors were free to suggest different motives for his death"".
In the version that was offered by the Hellenistic poet Callimachus, which has become the standard setting, Artemis was bathing in the woods when the hunter Actaeon stumbled across her, thus seeing her naked.
He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty.
Once seen, Artemis got revenge on Actaeon: she forbade him speech — if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a stag — for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery.
Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately transformed.
At this he fled deep into the woods, and doing so he came upon a pond and, seeing his reflection, groaned.
His own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him, not recognizing him.
In an endeavour to save himself, he raised his eyes (and would have raised his arms, had he had them) toward Mount Olympus.
The gods did not heed his plea, and he was torn to pieces.
An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger.
In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that Chiron made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.
There are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and pseudo-Apollodoran Bibliotheke state that his offense was that he was a rival of Zeus for Semele, his mother's sister, whereas in Euripides' Bacchae he has boasted that he is a better hunter than Artemis:  Further materials, including fragments that belong with the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and at least four Attic tragedies, including a Toxotides of Aeschylus, have been lost.
Diodorus Siculus (481.
4), in a variant of Actaeon's hubris that has been largely ignored, has it that Actaeon wanted to marry Artemis.
Other authors say the hounds were Artemis' own; some lost elaborations of the myth seem to have given them all names and narrated their wanderings after his loss.
According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman Ovid having accidentally seen Diana (Artemis) on Mount Cithaeron while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.
This version also appears in Callimachus' Fifth Hymn, as a mythical parallel to the blinding of Tiresias after he sees Athena bathing.
The literary testimony of Actaeon's myth is largely lost, but Lamar Ronald Lacy, deconstructing the myth elements in what survives and supplementing it by iconographic evidence in late vase-painting, made a plausible reconstruction of an ancient Actaeon myth that Greek poets may have inherited and subjected to expansion and dismemberment.
His reconstruction opposes a too-pat consensus that has an archaic Actaeon aspiring to Semele, a classical Actaeon boasting of his hunting prowess and a Hellenistic Actaeon glimpsing Artemis' bath.
Lacy identifies the site of Actaeon's transgression as a spring sacred to Artemis at Plataea where Actaeon was a hero archegetes (""hero-founder"") The righteous hunter, the companion of Artemis, seeing her bathing naked at the spring, was moved to try to make himself her consort, as Diodorus Siculus noted, and was punished, in part for transgressing the hunter's ""ritually enforced deference to Artemis"" (Lacy 1990:42).
